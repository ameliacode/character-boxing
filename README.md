## Character Boxing in GAN-based methods

Code from "Exploring the Effectiveness of GAN-based approach and Reinforcement Learning in Character Boxing Task"

Look for papers [here]() <del>papers will be out soon</del>

---

### Installation

out downstream tasks are based on [ASE]() and [AMP]().  
Clone [ASE]() repository first, then follow the instructions from its repo.
To execute Multi Agent RL environment, clone [TimeChamber]().
  
Table down below is required setting for each project. Using  virtual env is recommended

|Project|Python|RL-games|    
|---|---|---|
| AMP/ASE(punching, joystick) | 3.7 | 1.1.4 |
| TimeChamber(boxing) | 3.7/3.8 | 1.5.2 |

## Preparation

Our repository only consists of task files.  
To train from scratch, see Preprocessing section.

 


### Preprocessing

All motion data used were from [CMU]()
We used data that were labeled as boxing and locomotion.
